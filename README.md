# LC NoWidth

## Introduction

Adjusts the min-width on LeetCode website to make the small-width window display correctly.

Due to the css design of LeetCode website, when the width of browser window is too small, the content will not wrap according to the width of the window, but will be truncated. That is, the content cannot be displayed fully in the window.  

The extension will change the CSS property `min-width` to `0px` in some HTML nodes of LeetCode website to change the overflow behavior of the content.
